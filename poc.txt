Data Validation Framework - Proof of Concept (POC)
Overview
This document provides a detailed proof of concept (POC) for a Data Validation Framework implemented using a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach. The framework aims to ensure data quality and integrity across various data extracts by performing multiple validations.

Features
Compare Extracts
Column Name Validation: Validates if the column names in two CSV extracts are identical.
Column Count Validation: Validates if the number of columns in two CSV extracts are the same.
Row Count Validation: Validates if the number of rows in two CSV extracts are the same.
Unique Value Validation: Validates if the unique values in two CSV extracts are the same.
Extract Validation
Field Name Validation: Validates if the field names in the CSV extract match the configured field names.
Field Format Validation: Validates the format of the fields as per the configuration.
Datatype Validation: Validates the data types of the fields as per the configuration.
Expected Values Validation: Validates if the values in the CSV extract match the expected values as per the configuration.
Whitespace Validation: Validates if there are any unnecessary whitespaces in the CSV extract.
Required Field Validation: Validates if all required fields are present in the CSV extract.
Duplicate Key Validation: Validates if there are any duplicate keys in the CSV extract.
Maximum Length Validation: Validates if the length of the values in the CSV extract does not exceed the maximum length specified in the configuration.
Implementation
Technology Stack
Python: Language used for scripting and data manipulation.
Pandas: Library used for data analysis and manipulation.
Behave: BDD framework used for writing and executing tests.
Confluence: Documentation platform.
Setup Instructions
Virtual Environment (venv) Setup
Navigate to your project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Linux/Mac:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas behave
Running BDD Tests
Place the BDD feature files in a directory named features.
Place the step definitions in a directory named steps.
Navigate to the project directory and activate the virtual environment.
Run the BDD tests using the following command:
bash
Copy code
behave
Code Structure
The POC includes the following Python scripts:

compare_extracts.py: Contains functions for comparing two CSV extracts based on column names, column count, row count, and unique values.
extract_validation.py: Contains functions for validating a single CSV extract based on field name, field format, datatype, expected values, whitespace, required fields, duplicate keys, and maximum length.
steps.py: Contains step definitions for BDD tests.
Code Snippets

@given('I have two CSV files "{csv_file1}" and "{csv_file2}"')
def step_impl(context, csv_file1, csv_file2):
    # Implementation
    pass

@when('I compare the extracts')
def step_impl(context):
    # Implementation

    pass
Conclusion
The POC demonstrates the capabilities of the Data Validation Framework in ensuring data quality and integrity across various data extracts using a BDD approach. Future enhancements may include additional validation types, improved error handling, and integration with other data quality tools.
